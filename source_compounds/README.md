# SMILESMerge

SMILESMerge is a cheminformatic, Python program for that crosses two parent ligands (SMILES string) to create a child compound. SMILESMerge uses the crossover algorithm from the program AutoGrow4.

SMILESMerge accepts a list of SMILES (in .smi format) and will attempt to produce a user defined number of unique children SMILES. SMILESMerge also allows users to apply chemical property filters. Additionally, SMILESMerge options the automated conversion of the children from 1/2D SMILES to 3D representations (PDB and 3D-SDF) using Gypsum-DL.
